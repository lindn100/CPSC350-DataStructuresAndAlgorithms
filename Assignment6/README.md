# Assignment 6 - Sorting Algorithms

For my own sorting algorithm, I implemented Bogo Sort, which is possibly the worst sorting algorithm ever. Therefore, if you try to run my analysis on any sort of big file, it may take literally forever. Thus, if you want to test if I implemented it correctly, use a small data set at first, and then use a big data set for the other algorithms(but again, Bogo Sort may never finish).
