# Assignment3 - Syntax Checker

1. Template implementation of the stack was based off of using templates from a 10 hr long YouTube video that I watched to learn C++: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQZ1qmKlLY
2. The CommandLineChecker logic was from the first assignment. See that assignment for references on the basis of the logic
3. Stack was implemented in class for the most part. Thanks Rene
4. Reference for throwing a runtime error when popping an empty stack: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26171631/throwing-a-run-time-error
